The Revamp earbuds' housings are crafted from aircraft-grade aluminum and achieve a near-universal fit thanks to two design features unique to V-Moda: first, the conical shape of the metal housing is only slightly larger than the silicone fittings, and this allows the earpieces to rest comfortably just before the deeper crevice of your ear canal.

Keep in mind that you aren't supposed to jam these headphones all the way into your ear canal like the Etymotic ER-4PT MicroPro earphones, but you should still be able to create a tight seal (crucial to getting the best sound) using one of the four sizes of silicone fittings: XS, S, M, and L.
